This course provides insight into the intersection of media and crime and the subsequent influence this has on public policy. Every citizen, every day, has contact with the media in some form. Newspapers, advertising, television, etc. all have an impact on our lives. The list of media forms has grown rapidly-in addition to more traditional sources of media, we now rely on websites, social network sites, and blogs. From the beginning of this ""American experiment,"" crime and criminal justice have held a prominent place in media. Today, this focus on crime and entertainment that centers on crime is widespread. This explains why people who rely on media for their information about crime and criminal justice often hold misconceptions about the nature of crime, criminal justice practices, and criminals themselves. It is imperative that future practitioners in the field of criminal justice come to an understanding of this phenomenon. Because much of public policy stems from reaction to voters' opinions, how voters form these opinions matters greatly. If there are minor or gross misconceptions surrounding the criminal justice system and voters galvanize what we refer to as ""living room policy-making,"" the results can be ineffective, irresponsible, or injurious.

This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach to crime and delinquency, both as a philosophical and historical exercise in corrections and contemporary criminal justice systems. Provides an understanding of how crime plays a role in the historic development of the criminal justice system. This course provides insight into the intersection of media and crime and the subsequent influence this has on public policy. Every citizen, every day, has contact with the media in some form. Newspapers, advertising, television, etc. all have an impact on our lives. The list of media forms has grown rapidly-in addition to more traditional sources of media, we now rely on websites, social network sites, and blogs. From the beginning of this ""American experiment,"" crime and criminal justice have held a prominent place in media. Today, this focus on crime and entertainment that centers on crime is widespread. This explains why people who rely on media for their information about crime and criminal justice often hold misconceptions about the nature of crime, criminal justice practices, and criminals themselves. It is imperative that future practitioners in the field of criminal justice come to an understanding of this phenomenon. Because much of public policy stems from reaction to voters' opinions, how voters form these opinions matters greatly. If there are minor or gross misconceptions surrounding the criminal justice system and voters galvanize what we refer to as ""living room policy-making,"" the results can be ineffective, irresponsible, or injurious.

This course provides insight into the intersection of media and crime and the subsequent influence this has on public policy. Every citizen, every day, has contact with the media in some form. Newspapers, advertising, television, etc. all have an impact on our lives. The list of media forms has grown rapidly-in addition to more traditional sources of media, we now rely on websites, social network sites, and blogs. From the beginning of this ""American experiment,"" crime and criminal justice have held a prominent place in media. Today, this focus on crime and entertainment that centers on crime is widespread. This explains why people who rely on media for their information about crime and criminal justice often hold misconceptions about the nature of crime, criminal justice practices, and criminals themselves. It is imperative that future practitioners in the field of criminal justice come to an understanding of this phenomenon. Because much of public policy stems from reaction to voters' opinions, how voters form these opinions matters greatly. If there are minor or gross misconceptions surrounding the criminal justice system and voters galvanize what we refer to as ""living room policy-making,"" the results can be ineffective, irresponsible, or injurious.

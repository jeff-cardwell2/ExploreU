Recent trends in ""big data"" present both enormous challenges and opportunities for businesses. This course introduces concepts and techniques of data analytics and shows how they can be used for making predictions, and to distinguish between correlation and causation, in the context of financial and economic analysis. Covered tools include data visualization, machine learning, regression analysis, randomized trials, A/B testing, and quasi-experiments. Students will apply these tools using R programming within the Amazon Web Services cloud computing environment. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Credit is not given for FIN 550 if the student has received credit for FIN 510 Big Data Analytics in Finance for Predictive and Causal Analysis (71511, 71512, 71513, 72873, 72874, 72875). Prerequisite: Consent of Instructor.
 
The aim of this course is to equip students with a working knowledge of important econometric techniques necessary to understand and interpret financial market data. The course covers time-series and cross-sectional properties of asset returns, predictability of equity returns, empirical tests of asset pricing models, modelling time-varying volatility. The interplay between asset pricing theories, statistical assumptions and relevant econometric techniques is explored in the context of published empirical work, including classical papers as well as a more recent research. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Credit is not given for FIN 552 and FIN 580 Section DK2 (72033) or FIN 580 Section DK (70390). Prerequisite: FIN 511.
 
Covers selected topics in financial risk management. The focus is on statistical techniques used in financial risk management rather than risk management practice, cases, or valuation issues. The course will cover the value-at-risk (VaR) measure and expected shortfall, statistical techniques useful to model financial market returns, and techniques used to model the joint distribution of defaults on fixed income instruments. The course will also cover additional topics such as retail credit risk, risk budgeting, and economic capital modelling. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Credit is not given for FIN 537 if the student has received credit for FIN 567 Financial Risk Management (65639, 65640). Prerequisite: FIN 500 or 511; IE 522 or FIN 502; FIN 512 (concurrent enrollment allowed); or consent of instructor.
 
Machine Learning includes the design and the study of algorithms that can learn from experience, improve their performance and make predictions. In this course students will learn the foundations of Machine Learning and explore state of the art algorithms and tools. Topics include supervised learning (neural networks, support vector machines), unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction) and reinforcement learning (dynamic programming, Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradient methods). Applications include option pricing, portfolio selection and credit card fraud detection. Students will gain practical experience implementing these models in Python with frequently used packages such as TensorFlow. 2 or 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Credit is not given for FIN 553 and FIN 580: Section V2, (72206); or FIN 580: Section V1 (72205).
 
Recent years have seen the rapid development of the fintech sector, bringing together technology and data, startups and established firms in ways that are likely to shape and disrupt financial markets going forward. This course will involve a mix of lectures, guest speakers, and class discussion of breaking developments and new ventures. Some of the fintech sectors we will discuss include consumer finance, payments, investing and trading, cryptocurrencies and blockchain, and privacy and regulatory concerns. Because of the innovative and rapidly evolving nature of the fintech sector, this class will depend heavily on student engagement and class discussion. Students should be prepared to participate actively, and not just sit and listen to lectures. Each student will participate in two group presentations on the fintech sector, at the middle and end of the semester. A group project is due at the end of the semester, detailing a fintech startup idea, an analysis of an existing fintech business, or an analysis of a fintech sector. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Credit is not given for FIN 555 and FIN 580: Section FT2 (72037).
 
Proper data handling and management is essential to the success of data analysis. The primary goal of this course is to learn principles and practices of data management with an emphasis on working with financial databases. Students will gain practical skills in data storage, data preparation, and data extractions that eventually lead to data analysis. Data management procedures including SQL queries, and data analysis techniques using large-scale statistical software are presented. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Credit is not given toward graduation if credit has been received in FIN 580 CRN 60175 Section G1, FIN 580 CRN 60175 Section GFD, FIN 580 CRN 46819 Section FD2. Prerequisite: Restricted to MS: Finance, MS:Business Analytics.
 
Lectures and discussions relating to new areas of interest. See class schedule for topics and prerequisites. 0 to 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Approved for Letter and S/U grading. May be repeated to a maximum of 18 hours in a semester; may be repeated to a maximum of 32 hours in subsequent semesters. Credit is not given for FIN 528 and FIN 580 (66393), Section ADF.

In this two-semester course students will engage in the collaborative design and execution of a year-long Instrumentation and measurement-intensive technical project. Required activities will include a written project proposal of work to be undertaken, informal group-generated oral presentations on technical issues, periodic formal written progress reports, a final project oral presentation, and a final project paper. The set of projects might include investigations suggested by industry partners. There will be two class meetings per week, each of three hours duration. In addition to the project work, we will bring in local experts to discuss a number of relevant topics with the class; these are shown in the syllabus, below. Note that readings will consist primarily of technical materials and documentation by the producers of components used by individual projects. As a result, readings and external materials will vary from group to group. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. May be repeated in separate terms to a total of 8 hours. Prerequisite: Students must enroll in consecutive fall and spring semesters to meet the requirements of the Concentration in Instrumentation and Applied Physics under the Master of Engineering in Engineering degree. Primarily for students in the Engineering: Instrumentation and Applied Physics, MEng program. Other students may enroll with permission of the M.Eng. program director.
 
Introduce students to a broader spectrum of devices than they can be expected to encounter in their Physics 523 projects. The goal of the course is to familiarize students with some of the techniques available to them when defining and proposing a technical project in an unfamiliar domain. There will be two 50 minute classes each week, split into a discussion of basic principles and a simple hands-on laboratory exercise. The list of topics—which is not intended to be exhaustive—will evolve, according to the interests of the class and instructors. Material will be clustered into units of varying duration, as indicated below. The lists of suggested readings and references are advisory; a large amount of material of excellent quality is now available on the worldwide web, particularly on the sites of university courses addressing the topics of each unit. There are no formal prerequisites other than prior completion of a rigorous undergraduate major (or minor) in physics, astronomy, or a related field. 2 graduate hours. No professional credit.

Designed to give students a solid foundation in machine learning applications to physics, positioning itself at the intersection of machine learning and data-intensive science. This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of analysis and interpretation of scientific data, and applications of machine learning to problems common in laboratory science such as classification and regression. There will be two 75-minute classes each week, split into discussions of core principles and hands-on exercises involving coding and data. There will be a few projects throughout semester that will build on the course material and utilize open source software and open data in physics and related fields. The list of topics will evolve, according to the interests of the class and instructors. Material will be clustered into units of varying duration, as indicated below. The lists of suggested readings and references are advisory; a large amount of material of excellent quality is now available on the worldwide web, particularly on the sites of university courses addressing the topics of each unit. A distinguishing feature of this course is its sharp focus on endeavors in the data-rich physical sciences as the arenas in which modern machine learning techniques are taught. The course uses open scientific data, open source software from data science and physics-related fields, and publicly-available information as enabling elements. Research-inspired projects are an important part of the course and students will not only execute them but will play an active role in helping define and shape them. Example projects might include machine learning approaches to searches for new particles or interactions at high-energy colliders; methods of particle tracking and reconstruction; identification, classification and measurement of astrophysical phenomena; novel approaches to medical imaging and simulation using techniques from physics and machine learning; machine learning in quantum information science. Through these projects and the course material, students will learn how large datasets in physics are generated, curated, and analyzed, using machine learning as a tool to generate key insights in both experimental and theoretical science. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: Familiarity with a high-level computing language such as C++, Python, or Java; mathematical competence typical of graduates (either as majors or minors) from undergraduate programs in Physics and Astronomy. Primarily for students in the Engineering: Instrumentation and Applied Physics, MEng program. Other students may enroll with permission of the M.Eng. program director.

Research-inspired projects are an important part of the course and students will not only execute them but will play an active role in helping define and shape them. Example projects might include machine learning approaches to searches for new particles or interactions at high-energy colliders; methods of particle tracking and reconstruction; identification, classification and measurement of astrophysical phenomena; novel approaches to medical imaging and simulation using techniques from physics and machine learning; machine learning in quantum information science. Through these projects and the course material, students will learn how large datasets in physics are generated, curated, and analyzed, using machine learning as a tool to generate key insights in both experimental and theoretical science. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: Familiarity with a high-level computing language such as C++, Python, or Java; mathematical competence typical of graduates (either as majors or minors) from undergraduate programs in Physics and Astronomy.

Databases are important because they play a critical role in today's business environment. Almost all modern organizations use database technologies to store and manage data in every functional area of business including its operations, finance, accounting, and marketing. By understanding data modeling and being able to query databases, you possess one of the most marketable skills to help a business better manage their data and discover new opportunities through better analytics. At the end of this course you will be able to (a) Understand and help articulate the data needs of the company (requirement analysis), (b) Conceptually model the relationship of the data (data modeling), (c) Query databases to meet business requirements, (d) Understand the principles of design of data warehouses, (e) Understand the alternatives to relational databases (no SQL) with reference to storing Big Data, and (f) Explain the benefits of distributed databases 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Credit is not given for both BADM 554 and BADM 352.
 
Once a researcher or a practitioner has completed the analyses of their data, they may assume that it is a simple process to communicate their findings to relevant stakeholders, but this is almost always an incorrect assumption. Proper data communication and storytelling begins even before data are analyzed and there are proven strategies to better connect the story behind and from the data to relevant stakeholders, especially within the context of business practice. This course will focus on helping students better position themselves to successfully tell the persuasive story flowing from their data. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

This course provides a graduate-level treatment of the analysis and prediction of the Earth's climate over subseasonal, seasonal, and decadal time scales. Following the preliminaries on how these scales are realized in climate observations, we will describe the drivers of the climate system across these scales. Modes of natural climate variability, which include El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), will then be described, as will the statistical techniques used to reveal them. Statistical prediction models based on multivariate regressions often incorporate index-representations of ENSO and other relevant variables. Accordingly, we will devote some time and exercises on methods in which these models are developed as well as tested. Dynamical models are also used for climate prediction, but require computational capability and relatively more thought in design and application. Thus, we will complete the course with a significant treatment of global models as well as regional models. Both models are based on the same basic set of equations, but typically have different applications. Model setup and implementation will be illustrated through practical exercises with open-source community global and regional models. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit.

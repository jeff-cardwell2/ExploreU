Together students will examine sources on premodern Korean warfare, society, sex, politics, religion, and culture to understand how this seemingly distant past continues to shape Korea’s present and future. We will also explore the influence of Korean civilization on regional and global histories beyond the peninsula. | This course traces Korea’s history from its unified rule under the Choson dynasty (1392-1910) to Japanese colonization (1910-1945) and subsequent division into the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea) and Republic of Korea (South Korea). It examines how processes of reform, empire, civil war, revolution, and industrialization shaped both Koreas’ development and how ordinary people experienced this tumultuous history. | Surveys the social, political and economic organization of traditional Chinese society, traditional Chinese foreign policy, and major literary, artistic, and intellectual movements. | Survey of the social, political, and cultural history of China from 10th to the early 20th centuries.

The course raises China-centered questions because it is curious in retrospect that China, a quintessential Eastern state, became so deeply involved in the Cold War, a confrontation rooted in Western history. In exploring such questions, this course does not treat China as part of the Cold War but the Cold War as a period of Chinese history. | The course explores Chinese-American relations since the late 18th century. Starting as an encounter between a young trading state and an ageless empire on the two sides of the Pacific Ocean, the relationship has gone through stages characterized by the two countries’ changing identities.

What is the range of experience that characterizes American adolescence across gender, race, and class lines? How does it make sense to think about the social influence of films on individuals and society? | What is the difference between individual and self? Do we carry a fixed, unchangeable self inside, or do we have as many selves as the situations in which we commonly find ourselves? Can we go as far as saying that the self comes from the outside, and if so, when do we internalize it? At birth, once and for all? Or repeatedly and in everyday life? We will explore these questions and more as we venture into an exciting field-sociology of the self. | Focuses on the construction of gender and sexuality, and of the many ways human groups regulate and attach meanings to these categories.

In its American configuration, anthropology combines a variety of archaeological, text-analytic, and ethnographic methods that can be used to inquire human social life in virtually any historical and geographic context that we can gather evidence about. This means that anthropology is well situated for providing multifaceted, long-range insights into a wide range of social problems. It also means that self-reflexivity-in other words, the development of awareness of one’s own self and society-is built into the discipline. This course aims to demonstrate what it means to apply anthropological perspectives to some pressing contemporary problems, both globally and in the U.S. context. Our hope is that you emerge from this course with a richer understanding of these problems, a solid overview of anthropology as an academic discipline, and the ability to apply anthropological perspectives to the problems that you encounter beyond this course in a thoughtful way.",45.02

Methods include randomized control trials, natural experiments, instrumental variables, difference-in-differences, matching, regression discontinuity, and synthetic control. Examples explore the causal effect of policies, laws, programs and “natural experiments,” primarily drawn from development, public, and labor economics. Students apply these methods to their own research design and present this design and their findings at the semester’s conclusion. | This course combines calculus, statistics, economic theory, and programming to answer macroeconomic questions. Macroeconomic models range from the reduced-form to the structural. This course familiarizes students with vector autoregressions that are useful for establishing facts from data. We will then explore the application of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, which are the workshorse models of central banks and other macroeconomic policy institutions, to understand those facts. | This course examines the use of Bayesian estimation methods for a wide variety of settings in applied economics. After a brief primer on Bayesian statistics, we will examine the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for parameter estimation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. We will explore heirarchical models (such as mixed regression), multivariate probit, and time series models and apply these to a variety of policy and scientific questions.  A significant focus of the course will be the communicating the degree of scientific knowledge and uncertainty in a variety of settings including Oped’s, blog posts, and scientific notebooks which will be targeted to a variety of audiences. | This course is focused on studying financial assets and the capital markets in which they are traded. The course belongs to the larger field of financial economics. It will provide analytical tools and derive formal models in asset pricing. The set of tools is used to understand how different assets are priced in the market and the relationship between risk and return. This course is meant to train students to think in a structured, analytical rigorous way about the fundamentals of asset pricing models, starting from the notions of market efficiency and ending with risk management principles. The course emphasizes case studies, group work, and interactive class discussions. Finally, this course will help prepare students entering graduate education or starting careers in management, finance, or economic consulting. | This research-intensive and technical course is concerned with two fields.    The Economics of Human Capital studies investments in human skills and health.   The Economics of Human Development combines methods of economics with results from psychology, epidemiology, genetics and biology to uncover the developmental origins of health, wealth and other essential life outcomes. Students learn how to apply advanced econometric and psychometric methods, critically discuss original research, and write an original research paper. | This course examines energy markets including markets for oil, refined petroleum products, natural gas, electricity and renewable energies. The course provides an empirical, time series econometric study of energy demand and supply and how energy markets interact with the rest of the economy. Students will learn methods used to study energy markets and develop independent research in energy economics. | In this course, we will analyze the peculiarities of media markets and the role of media in politics and other parts of the society from an economic perspective. The course will cover basic media economic concepts as well as go into the political economy of the media. | The development of economic analysis with emphasis upon classical and neo-classical economics. | This course uses the American experience to better understand why some countries have prospered while other parts of the world remain poor. Students will be exposed to academic research in economics, history, political science, and health. Students will also read primary source documents. Students will learn how to apply economic theory as well as a mix of qualitative and quantitative techniques in order to conduct independent research in the field of economic history. | This course explores the evolution of economic inequality and mobility in the United States from the Civil War to modern times. We will evaluate different methods of measuring inequality and mobility and then use those measures to assess how major events and structural changes to the economy altered economic mobility for different groups. Particular attention will be given to how to econometrically identify causal relationships between these events and changes in mobility. The course will focus primarily on comparing differences in economic mobility over time across gender and across race. We will explore the impacts of such events as the Great Migration, the High School Movement, passage of the 19th Amendment, and school desegregation on inequality and mobility. | A theoretical and empirical analysis of labor demand and supply behavior. Topics include labor force participation, labor mobility and wage differentials, the economics of labor unions, and analyses of minimum wage, occupational safety and health, and unemployment insurance. | America is one of the wealthiest countries in the world yet continues to struggle with high rates of poverty.  Even our cherished Williamsburg has a homelessness problem.  This course will consider poverty in America with particular attention to public policies that mitigate or exacerbate the problem.  Students will learn about details of public policies such as cash assistance, housing assistance, food stamps, minimum wages, healthcare provision, and discrimination law.  Students will quantify the scale and distribution of poverty by using government data to measure family incomes, work hours, health outcomes, and housing characteristics.  We probably won’t end poverty, but we’ll move in the right direction by understanding it better. | This course applies economic analysis to the study of health and health care. Topics include: the determinants of health status, features of the market for medical care, insurance and health care delivery, and the role of government in the health care sector. | This seminar explores the economics of higher education. We explore the economic and political forces that affect student demand for higher education and that shape the behavior of colleges and universities. Specific topics include the return to higher education, the drivers of college cost, how tuition is set, the workings of financial aid, and how education is financed.  | Economic analysis is employed to explain the existence of prevailing legal rules in standard areas of legal study such as property, contracts, torts, family law, civil procedure and criminal procedure. | The goal of this course is provide you with the theoretical foundations and practical skills to evaluate Industrial policies that can profoundly affect entrepreneurial choices and competition. In particular, we look into policies that can affect entrepreneurial occupational choice, business formation, pricing strategies, legal forms, advertising, and innovation. This class builds the micro-economic theories you have learned from Econ 303, and apply these concepts using the econometric methodology from Econ 308. | The goal of this course is to provide you with the theoretical foundations and practical skills that you will need to be thoughtful producers and consumers of cost-benefit analyses (or benefit-cost, depending on the author) and other forms of policy evaluation. The class builds on the microeconomic foundations that you learned in Econ 303 and focuses on applying those concepts using skills from Econ 308 to evaluate public policies, particularly through the development of cost-benefit analyses. The class will cover both theoretical topics as well as practical applications. In addition to the analytic tools that you will learn in the course, we will also work on effective communication techniques including written reports and memoranda, preparing effective graphs and figures, and presenting analysis results to an audience. At the end of the semester you should have a deeper understanding about how economic analysis can inform policy development and evaluation. | This capstone seminar explores the interplay between new technologies and radical changes in the patterns of global production and trade for industrial goods. Since 1990, a remarkable combination of ICT technologies, deep liberalization, and ample supply of skilled labor in emerging economies has produced a multipolar and yet tightly integrated global economic order. Manufacturing production is fusing with services but rapidly disintegrating spatially between headquarter economies and factory economies. The research seminar explores the remarkable consequences of technological change for catchup industrialization, multilateral governance, and inter-country and intra-country economic inequality. | The theory and practice of preferential economic arrangements, and their impact on various groups and the multilateral system. Seminar covers the stages of regional integration (free trade area, customs union, economic and monetary union), regionalism versus multilateralism, and interest-group politics around bilateralism and regionalism. Students apply theory to cross-country data or to case studies in their research, including on NAFTA, the EU, agreements in Africa, Asia, Eurasia, Latin America, and the WTO.  | This course will introduce students to modern business cycle macroeconomics with a focus on using micro-data to inform and discipline macroeconomic models. It will include a survey of business cycle models that help us understand the effects of policy. The course will cover a variety of empirical methods and data sources that can be used to test, calibrate, and develop models for macroeconomics. We will discuss identification of macroeconomic outcomes through structural, narrative, and cross-sectional approaches. Specific topics will include fiscal and monetary policy, firm investment behavior, the effects of uncertainty shocks, and financial frictions. | Explores models of economic growth with emphasis on developing economies. Examines proximates causes (factor accumulation and technology), correlates (industrialization, demography, inequality), fundamentals (geography, history, culture, institutions), and policy implications. Blends theory with empirical evidence on the convergence and divergence of percapita incomes. | A faculty-directed research course conducted on an individual or small group basis on various topics in economics. The student is required to submit a preliminary draft, and submit a final research report.

Students will practice close reading and critical writing informed by various interpretive models. Course readings will include four to six primary literary texts selected from different historical periods, genres, traditions, and perspectives. | A survey of British literature from 1675-1900. The course includes Augustan satire, Romantic and Victorian poetry, and the Victorian novel. | A survey of British literature of the Middle Ages and Renaissance. The course covers narrative, dramatic, and lyric poetry, including works by Chaucer, Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton. | An introduction to American literature through an analysis of major continuing themes, such as the meaning of freedom; literature and the environment; urban-rural dichotomies. | This course studies the cultural productions of settler, indigenous, and enslaved Americans in response to European contact and colonization, imperial expansion, and early national independence. The course considers historical accounts and reportage, philosophical and theological polemics, legends, essays, poetry, drama, and fiction. Major figures studied may include John Smith, Anne Bradstreet, Jonathan Edwards, Benjamin Franklin, Phillis Wheatley Peters, Washington Irving, and Black Hawk. | Literatures of American Nationalism and the Crisis of Slavery examines the ways in which U.S. authors from different backgrounds, genders, ethnicities, and points of view created and debated an “American” identity in the decades leading up to the Civil War. We will be putting these authors in conversation with each other as they seek, in ways conventional and radical, to narratively construct a nation they could be proud to-or in some cases, allowed to-live in. This course satisfies the Constructions of Race requirement for the English major. | A survey of American literature from the end of the Civil War to the First World War, tracking the many transformations and debates in American literary culture.  Writers may include Charles Chesnutt, Theodore Dreiser, Pauline Hopkins, Henry James, Zitkala-Sa, Mark Twain, and Edith Wharton. | A study of modern American writing from the early teens, through and beyond the two world wars.

Proceeding chronologically, we’ll concentrate on Austen’s six major novels, but we’ll also read some of her letters, juvenilia and unfinished pieces of fiction.  The main goal of the course is to enhance students’ appreciation and understanding of Austen’s development through close reading of her works.  In class discussions and in both formal and informal writing assignments, students will analyze the relationships between on the one hand, the language, structure and form of the novels and on the other hand, themes such as family dynamics, courtship, education, politeness, and psychological growth.  We’ll also pay attention to various contexts that illuminate Austen’s stylistic and thematic choices and strategies, approaching Austen’s works in terms of biography, British history, and the development of the genre of the novel, as well as recent scholarly criticism.  In addition, we’ll extend the pleasures and intellectual rewards of studying Austen by discussing various screen adaptations of her novels.  | Ernest Hemingway has come to embody a dizzying array of (contradictory) meanings for America: the “man’s man,” the tortured genius, the misogynist, the articulate representative of a “lost generation.”  In this course we’ll be exploring the myths, the man, and his writing through historical, biographical, and literary criticism.  In what ways does Hemingway–his life and his art–represent the shift from Victorian to modern world views? How does his innovative and influential writing style both reflect and shape that newly emerging modern consciousness?  Despite his personal flaws, Hemingway believed that, as Miranda Mellis puts it, writers write “not, finally, to reduce experience to a formula, but rather to convert confusion into curiosity, to face questions that don’t have easy answers, and to create spaces in which others, be they students or readers, might do the same.” | Drawing from Wharton’s long career, which depicted mid-nineteenth century social life through the flapper era, this course reads Wharton’s work in relation to changing cultural contexts, including: transatlanticism, cultures of consumption, models of marriage, divorce, women’s rights, servant life, materialisms, the gothic, cultural memory, old age, passionate manhood, cross-generational relations, and aesthetic representations. Readings include gothic tales, well-known novels such as The House of Mirth and The Age of Innocence, novellas, literary and cultural criticism. | In this course, students study selections from Geoffrey Chaucer’s works (among them The Canterbury Tales, Troilus and Criseyde, The Book of the Duchess, and shorter lyrics) in order to appreciate his literary artistry and gain a better understanding of the Middle Ages. | If there is no duplication of topic, course may be repeated once for credit. | John Milton’s career spanned a highly tumultuous period of English history that includes the Civil Wars, the period of the Commonwealth, and the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. A poet and a polemicist, Milton was actively engaged in the many social, political and theological debates that shaped this period of English history. In this course we will study Milton’s major poetic and prose works, with emphasis given to the epic Paradise Lost and its various political, theological and literary contexts. | An intensive study of the text in Old English; reading of the poem’s classical, Christian, and Norse analogues, and of selected literary criticism across the history of the poem’s study. | A study of selected works from the Arthurian literary tradition. Major emphasis is upon authors from the medieval period (e.g., Geoffrey of Monmouth, Chrétien de Troyes and Malory), but some attention is also given to Arthurian literature in the 19th and 20th centuries. | If there is no duplication of topic, may be repeated for credit. | A survey of selected major works and other representative examples of Old and Middle English literature, exclusive of Chaucer.

This course introduces students to the study of language contact and how social factors surrounding contact contribute to change in language systems. It provides the historical context in which the study of language contact developed and answers questions like “What (and where) exactly is language contact?” and “Can language change be predicted on the basis of the social configuration in which individuals find themselves?” As an inherently interdisciplinary field, language contact studies draw on psycholinguistic, social and linguistic perspectives to answer these questions. Core sociolinguistic phenomena examined include speech accommodation, linguistic areas, pidgins, creoles, mixed languages, code-switching and borrowing. |   | In this course, we will use the linguistic methods of discourse analysis to understand language in its linguistic and social contexts.

Students will learn to use freely-available phonetics software to examine, measure, and analyze human speech sounds. The acoustic differences between different speech sounds, such as what distinguishes consonants from vowels, will be introduced and explored. We’ll look at how both the length and the articulation of a sound can often be different in ways we’re not conscious of but that we can find, measure, and then quantify using statistical software that’s free through W&M. We’ll examine what influences people’s perceptions of sounds: that in some cases humans can perceive two very different sounds as the same and in other cases can perceive two very similar sounds as quite different.

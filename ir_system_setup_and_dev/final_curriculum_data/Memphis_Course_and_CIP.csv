It presents a framework for understanding what distinguishes youth and what supports their development and growth. The history of the field, research in the field, and practices in the field will be explored to serve as a foundation for understanding the concentration. | Description: This course provides an overview of youth development through a brief historical analysis and continues on to contemporary ideas about youth development.  This also includes recent ideas about youth in society and the interactions between both.  It examines current trends and counter trends in contemporary society related to renewed interests in this field.  The course also contains information to help students understand how the field has advanced toward a movement and what this means for youth and for the professions in the field.  | Description: This course considers issues of human diversity including race, ethnicity, culture, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, gender and ability.

Students will learn about important approaches to these frameworks and specific practices that lead toward equity and empowerment. | Description: This course considers issues of individual and social identities. It begins with examining “Who are you?” and extends to “Who are you as members of various social groups?” Therefore, the individual, social and cultural identities are examined and explored.  These identities are subsequently connected to the meanings of culture and identity and to the connection of both to youth development. Individual and collective experiences and stories of youth will serve as ways to depend students cultural and identity development.    | Description: This course provides students with fundamentals of policy, legal and ethical knowledge about working with youth. The course includes laws and legal issues relating to working with youth, ethical expectations in working with you, and appropriate practices as youth workers. Local, state, and national policies and ethical practices will be examined. Laws and legal issues relating to engaging with youth will be developed to assure preparedness to engage with youth in individual and group settings. The students will develop an understanding of the legal and ethical responsibilities they must be guided by in providing programs for youth and in working with families and communities. Specific youth development organization ethical standards and expectations will also be analyzed. | Description: In this course, students will explore the various meaningful and powerful ways in which youth develop as leaders in their families, schools, organizations and communities. The ways in which this occurs naturally will then be used to explore youth development programs and organizations at the local, state, national and international levels. Students will learn the foundations of youth leadership development, program development and evaluation, funding supports, and most critically program monitoring and implementation. They will learn how to use data to inform program design and redesign to meet the needs of adolescents. | Description: This course explores the role advocacy in societies. The general theoretical foundations and critical issues surrounding advocacy will be followed by elements of advocacy planning and strategy particularly as it relates to various types of youth advocacy.  Community organizing will be discussed around it connecting to youth advocacy and community building and development.  The bridge between human rights advocacy and campaigns will be explicitly related to advocacy for youth in all contexts, but in urban contexts in particular. It explores innovative practices in approaching advocacy including the role of youth as partners in any advocacy work as well as the necessary alignment with families and communities.

Youth leadership will serve to identify how to strengthen programs and the profession beyond the traditional youth service models. | Description: This course is co-enrolled with Practicum hours and is designed as small group discussions to connect practicum learning with theory and practice. It provides students an opportunity to engage in critical thinking, discussion, and exploration of theory, practice, policy and the practicum experiences. Throughout the seminar, students have an opportunity to integrate the academic knowledge and perspectives taught throughout the program with practical experiences in the field. In addition, the seminar provides a forum for learning and building practice skills through interaction, self-reflection, role=play, case discussion and other experiential strategies. The Practicum Seminar is designed to operate as “communities of practice”, which focus on shared experiences, mutual support, and making sense of their learning and socialization in the field. And the practicum provides a space for sharing and support related to issues and challenges that arise in the field and as they develop advanced competencies and integrate knowledge, skills and dispositions of the profession. | Description: Planned and supervised full-time experience in a training setting appropriate to the student’s specialization area; opportunities to synthesize knowledge and skills and demonstrate professional competencies in an appropriate setting.

[G] | Description: Argumentation and debate is an important part of our lives. We might present an argument for a raise to a boss or argue in the papers we write. We debate in the classroom, the courthouse, or the halls of congress. While sometimes the goal of arguing is winning, arguing is best when it helps us get closer to the truth. But arguing well is not easy and many people do not realize that there is a logic to it. This course is a study of elementary methods of that logic. Through the examination of logical concepts and the logical structure of sentences, this course will teach us how to make inferences and reach conclusions in a way that avoids mistakes. This course will also investigate common logical fallacies, so we can avoid making them and defend ourselves against such fallacies. This course will focus on both formal and informal methods of logic and teach us that reasoning itself has a structure. | Description: History of philosophy from 7th century B.C. through early Middle Ages structured around major themes that shaped classical period, attention to cultural and historical settings in which they arose and to which they contributed; readings from philosophical and nonphilosophical sources.

This course is a study of elementary methods of that logic. Through the examination of logical concepts and the logical structure of sentences, this course will teach us how to make inferences and reach conclusions in a way that avoids mistakes. This course will also investigate common logical fallacies, so we can avoid making them and defend ourselves against such fallacies. This course will focus on both formal and informal methods of logic and teach us that reasoning itself has a structure. | Description: Application of basic statistical concepts and techniques to social analysis; description of data for single variables and for relationships between two variables; tests of significance for relationships between two variables involving sample data; use of packaged statistical computer programs for single- and two-variable analysis. | Description: Comparative study of racial and ethnic minorities in United States, how inequality is institutionalized in such areas as employment, education, political participation, and social relations; emphasis on how subordinate groups resist oppression and initiate social change.
